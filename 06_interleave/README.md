## Description

Create the function "interleave" that accepts two strings as arguments:

```
interleave("1,3,5,7", "2,4,6,8");
```

The task is to `interleave` the strings, using an in-place algorithm such that the resulting string (return value) looks like

```
interleave("1,3,5,7", "2,4,6,8");

// RETURNS:
// "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8"

```
