# Welcome to Assessment 00
Read the instructions below for more details on each problem and also how to start and submit your assessment. Good luck!

## Starting/Submission Instructions

### Starting

1. **Important:** Fork this repository to your own Github user account
2. Clone your forked repo to your local machine

This works just like the Test First JavaScript exercises that we've done - reverse engineer the test, write code to make the tests.

Complete these problems:

- 00_string_manipulation - 2.00 Points
- 01_reduce_right - 6.00 Points (the recursion spec is worth 3.00 out of the 6.00)
- 02_alternate_function_&_twice_function - 8.00 Points 
- 03_create_functions - 9.00 Points
- 04_keyAdder - 6.00 Points
- 05_macbooks - 6.00 Points (last spec is extra credit and worth 4 Points)
- 06_interleave - 8.00 Points

**Total Points: 45.00**
- Keep in mind that challenging test specs have a greater point value, these are generally test specs later in the test suite for each spec.

Reminder, **do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to. ***All solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

Each folder has a **README.md** file, **read the README files to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value.**

### Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, commit the changes to the git repository using the command: `git commit -am "submitting assessment"` Then, do two things:

1. Push your repository back to your own personal fork on Github.
2. Email a link of your FoundationsAssessment repository instructors+assessment@fullstackacademy.com.
